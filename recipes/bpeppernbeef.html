        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Jet:</strong> Hey Spike! It's ready! <br>
            <strong>Spike:</strong> What's cooking? <br>
            <strong>Jet:</strong> <em>Special</em> bell peppers and beef <br>
            <strong>Spike:</strong> You said bell peppers and beef. There's no <em>beef</em> in here. So you wouldn't call it bell peppers and beef now would you? <br>
            <strong>Jet:</strong> Yes, I would. <br>
            <strong>Spike:</strong> WELL IT'S NOT <br>
            <strong>Jet:</strong> It is when you're broke, alright?
